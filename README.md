![Smart-Lending/images/](https://github.com/noe2019/Smart-Lending/blob/main/images/loan.gif)

## Introduction

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the `financial_loan.csv` dataset, which contains information related to loan applications, approvals, and performances at a financial institution. As a data analyst, the primary aim is to extract actionable insights that will inform decision-making processes, optimize risk management, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

The analysis covers various aspects, including customer demographics, loan performance, risk assessment, profitability, and operational efficiency. By leveraging this dataset, the goal is to understand patterns and trends that impact the bank's loan portfolio, identify potential areas for improvement, and develop strategies to mitigate risks associated with loan defaults.
