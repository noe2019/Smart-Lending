![Smart-Lending/images/](https://github.com/noe2019/Smart-Lending/blob/main/images/loan.gif)

## Introduction

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the `financial_loan.csv` dataset, which contains information related to loan applications, approvals, and performances at a financial institution. As a data analyst, the primary aim is to extract actionable insights that will inform decision-making processes, optimize risk management, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

The analysis covers various aspects, including customer demographics, loan performance, risk assessment, profitability, and operational efficiency. By leveraging this dataset, the goal is to understand patterns and trends that impact the bank's loan portfolio, identify potential areas for improvement, and develop strategies to mitigate risks associated with loan defaults.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

List any packages, libraries, or software requirements needed to run the project.

### Installation

Provide instructions for setting up the project environment and installing dependencies.

## Data Overview

### Data Description

The `financial_loan.csv` dataset contains detailed information about loan applications processed by a financial institution. This dataset is used to analyze various aspects of loan performance, customer demographics, and risk management.

#### Number of Entries

The dataset consists of **38576 entries (rows)**. Each entry represents a unique loan application and contains various attributes related to the applicant and the loan itself.

#### Features

The dataset includes the twenty four (24) features (columns):

1. **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application.
2. **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
3. **Loan_Amount**: The amount of money requested by the borrower.
4. **Loan_Term**: The duration of the loan in months.
5. **Interest_Rate**: The interest rate applied to the loan.
6. **Loan_Type**: The type of loan (e.g., personal, mortgage, auto).
7. **Application_Date**: The date when the loan application was submitted.
8. **Approval_Status**: The status of the loan application (e.g., approved, rejected, pending).
9. **Credit_Score**: The credit score of the applicant at the time of application.
10. **Employment_Status**: The employment status of the applicant (e.g., employed, unemployed, self-employed).
11. **Annual_Income**: The annual income of the applicant.
12. **Age**: The age of the applicant.
13. **Gender**: The gender of the applicant.
14. **Marital_Status**: The marital status of the applicant.
15. **Dependents**: The number of dependents the applicant has.
16. **Region**: The geographical region where the applicant resides.
17. **Loan_Purpose**: The purpose for which the loan is being sought (e.g., home improvement, debt consolidation).
18. **Payment_History**: Historical record of payments made by the borrower.

#### Background Information

The dataset is compiled from a comprehensive collection of loan applications submitted from **January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2023**. This period provides a comprehensive view of loan activity over four years, allowing for analysis of trends and patterns within this timeframe.

The primary goals of analyzing this dataset include:

1 - Identifying trends in loan applications and approvals.
2 - Understanding customer segments and their borrowing behavior.
3 - Evaluating risk factors associated with loan defaults.
4 - Optimizing loan products and improving customer satisfaction.

#### Data Source and Collection

The dataset was collected from the bank's internal systems, which record every loan application and its related details. The data is anonymized to protect customer privacy and complies with data protection regulations.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Most columns have zero missing values except for 'emp_title', which has 1,438 missing entries. All missing values (NaN) in the 'emp_title' column with the string "Unknown".
