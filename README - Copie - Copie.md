## 1. Objectives

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of a financial institution's loan portfolio, focusing on:

1. **Understanding Borrower Demographics**: Gain insights into the characteristics of borrowers to inform strategic decisions.
2. **Assessing Loan Portfolio Health**: Evaluate the performance and risk factors associated with the loan portfolio.
3. **Automating Decision-Making**: Use data-driven insights to predict which current loan owner will most likely default a take proactive actions. Then build a model to assist decision-making for loan applications.

### 2.2. Data Source and Collection

This dataset was sourced from the bank's internal systems, recording every loan application and related details. The data has been anonymized to comply with data protection regulations.

### 2.3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Missing Values**: The `emp_title` column had 1,438 missing values, which were replaced with 'Unknown'.
- **Date Formatting**: Date columns were converted to `datetime` format for accuracy in time-based analysis.

## 3. SQL and DAX Queries

### SQL Queries

Below are some SQL queries used for this project's data extraction and analysis:

```sql
-- Create Database and Tables
CREATE DATABASE LoanPortfolioDB;

USE LoanPortfolioDB;

CREATE TABLE LoanData (
    LoanID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    IssueDate DATE,
    LoanAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    InterestRate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Term VARCHAR(10),
    Grade VARCHAR(2),
    SubGrade VARCHAR(3),
    HomeOwnership VARCHAR(20),
    AnnualIncome DECIMAL(15, 2),
    LoanStatus VARCHAR(20),
    DTI DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Purpose VARCHAR(50),
    AddressState VARCHAR(20),
    EmpLength VARCHAR(20),
    EmpTitle VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Load Data (Example for MySQL, modify for other SQL dialects)
LOAD DATA INFILE 'path_to_your/financial_loan.csv'
INTO TABLE LoanData
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

-- Total Loan Amount by State
SELECT 
    AddressState,
    SUM(LoanAmount) AS TotalLoanAmount
FROM LoanData
GROUP BY AddressState
ORDER BY TotalLoanAmount DESC;

-- Average Interest Rate by Credit Grade
SELECT 
    Grade,
    AVG(InterestRate) AS AvgInterestRate
FROM LoanData
GROUP BY Grade
ORDER BY AvgInterestRate DESC;

-- Number of Loans by Loan Status
SELECT 
    LoanStatus,
    COUNT(*) AS LoanCount
FROM LoanData
GROUP BY LoanStatus
ORDER BY LoanCount DESC;
```

### DAX Queries

Here are some DAX queries used for calculations in the dashboard:

```dax
-- Total Loan Amount
TotalLoanAmount = SUM(LoanData[LoanAmount])

-- Average Interest Rate
AvgInterestRate = AVERAGE(LoanData[InterestRate])

-- Number of Loans by Grade
LoanCountByGrade = COUNTROWS(LoanData)

-- Default Rate Calculation
DefaultRate = 
    DIVIDE(
        CALCULATE(COUNT(LoanData[LoanID]), LoanData[LoanStatus] = "Charged Off"),
        COUNT(LoanData[LoanID])
    )

-- Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
AvgDTI = AVERAGE(LoanData[DTI])

-- Loan Status Distribution
LoanStatusDistribution = 
    SUMMARIZE(
        LoanData, 
        LoanData[LoanStatus], 
        "LoanCount", COUNT(LoanData[LoanID])
    )
```

        financial_loan,
        financial_loan[address_state],
        "Number_of_Borrowers", [Number_of_Borrowers]
    ),
    [Number_of_Borrowers], DESC
)

        financial_loan[address_state],
        "Total_Loan_Amount", [Total_Loan_Amount]
    ),
    [Total_Loan_Amount], ASC
)
```

### 4.4. Geographic Insights

- **High Borrower Concentration**: States such as California, New York, and Texas are not only leading in the number of borrowers but also in the total loan amounts, which signifies high economic activity and greater loan demand in these regions.
- **Low Activity Regions**: States like Maine and Iowa, with the lowest number of borrowers and loan amounts, indicate under-served markets that might benefit from targeted financial products and services.

### 4.5. Recommendations

- **Deepen Market Penetration in High-Demand Areas**: Enhance the product offerings and marketing strategies in high-demand states to capture more of the existing market share.
- **Develop Tailored Products for Low-Demand States**: Research the unique needs of borrowers in low-activity states and develop specialized financial products that address those needs, potentially opening new markets for growth.

Here's the continuation for the fifth section, following the previously written fourth section, along with relevant SQL and DAX queries.

## 5. Loan Portfolio Health Assessment

In this section, we will assess the health of the loan portfolio by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan status distribution, default rates, delinquency rates, average loan amounts, interest rate analysis, credit grade distribution, and the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. This analysis is crucial for understanding the overall stability of the portfolio and identifying potential areas of risk.

### 5.1. Loan Status Distribution

#### 5.1.1. Distribution Table

| Loan Status  | Number of Loans | Total Loan Amount (USD) | Average Loan Amount (USD) | Proportion of Total Loans (%) |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fully Paid   | 32,145          | 351,358,350            | 10,930.42                  | 83.33                          |
| Charged Off  | 5,333           | 65,532,225             | 12,288.06                  | 13.82                          |
| Current      | 1,044           | 17,904,100             | 17,149.52                  | 2.71                           |
| Late         | 54              | 962,400                | 17,822.22                  | 0.14                           |

#### 5.1.2. SQL and DAX Queries

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Loan Status Distribution Query**

```sql
-- Query to get the distribution of loan statuses
SELECT 
    loan_status AS Status, 
    COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Loans, 
    SUM(loan_amount) AS Total_Loan_Amount, 
    AVG(loan_amount) AS Average_Loan_Amount,
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS Proportion_of_Total_Loans
FROM 
    financial_loan
GROUP BY 
    loan_status;
```

**DAX Queries:**

1. **Loan Status Distribution Measure**

```dax
-- DAX Measures for Loan Status Distribution
Number_of_Loans = COUNT(financial_loan[id])

Total_Loan_Amount = SUM(financial_loan[loan_amount])

Average_Loan_Amount = AVERAGE(financial_loan[loan_amount])

#### 5.7.3. Key Insights

- **Average DTI Ratio**: The mean DTI ratio provides a baseline for assessing the general debt burden of the borrowers. A lower average DTI indicates that borrowers generally have a manageable level of debt relative to their income.

- **Risk Concentration**: By examining the percentiles, particularly the 75th percentile, the analysis can identify borrowers who are at higher risk due to elevated DTI ratios. These borrowers are more likely to face difficulties in meeting their loan obligations.

- **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of the DTI ratios helps in understanding the spread or variability in debt levels among borrowers. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability, meaning some borrowers have significantly higher DTI ratios than others.

#### 5.7.4. Recommendations

1. **Targeted Interventions for High DTI Borrowers**: Borrowers who fall above the 75th percentile in DTI ratio should be monitored more closely, as they are at a higher risk of defaulting on their loans. The bank may consider offering financial counseling or restructuring their loan terms to prevent defaults.

2. **Enhanced Risk Assessment**: Incorporating DTI ratio analysis into the credit risk assessment process can improve the bank’s ability to predict and manage loan defaults. Loans to applicants with DTI ratios in the higher percentiles should be evaluated more rigorously.

3. **Loan Pricing Strategy**: Consider adjusting interest rates or loan terms based on the borrower's DTI ratio to mitigate risks. Higher DTI borrowers could be charged higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.

4. **Proactive Communication**: Establishing proactive communication with borrowers in the higher DTI range can help identify potential issues before they lead to delinquency or default. Offering alternative payment plans or financial advice can be beneficial.

By closely monitoring the DTI ratio distribution and implementing these recommendations, the bank can better manage its loan portfolio and reduce the risk of defaults.
